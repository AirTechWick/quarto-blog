## Introduction

- R has a meticulously maintained ecosystem, which is immensely valuable in a regulatory space
- In a regulatory setting, the trust of any software needs to be thoroughly documented (NOTE: replace with more precise wording based on HA documents)

## Goals

- Provide a community-maintained catalog of package quality indicators ("risk metrics")
- Serve quality indicators in a standard format
- Thoroughly document the system used to perform quality assessment
- Demonstrate how regulatory-ready risk assessments can be provided using public quality indicators
- Serve subsets of packages that conform to a specified risk tolerance
- Improve transparency of industry R package adoption, endorsement and regulator interaction

## An evolving R ecosystem

- (NOTE: show interaction between CRAN, RVH Reg R Repo (us), RC Submissions WG, RC Repositories WG, pharmaverse, other?)

# Interacting with the repo

## Packages risk filters

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Helper package for system administrators
- Restricts packages available for installation to those fitting in a policy
- Uses packages metadata in the repo
- May be use together with manual checks (e.g. read a statistical review)
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Example of automated filter for safety-critical activities:
  - Acceptance Criteria 1: “Code Coverage > 95% ”
  - Acceptance Criteria 2: “Package documentation available”

## Usage

```{r}
#| echo: false
summarize_available_packages <- function(ap) {
  out <- cbind(ap, data.frame("..." = "..."))
  out <- out[c(1:4, nrow(ap)), c("Package", "...")]
  out[4,] <- c("...", "...")
  rownames(out) <- c("1", "2", "3", "...", nrow(ap))
  out
}
```

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
### Unfiltered
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
available.packages()
```
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
### Filtered
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
fltr <- risk_filter(
  ReverseDependencies >= 0.99)
options(available_packages_filters = fltr)
available.packages()
```

# Repository ‘back-end’

## Repository forked from `r-hub/repos`

## Packages cohort validation

* Risk metrics calculated on packages with new versions and on their reverse dependencies
* Uses the GitHub API to fetch new release assets
