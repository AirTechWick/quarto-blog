The R Consortium recently interviewed [Sanket Sinojia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ssinojia/?originalSubdomain=in), organizer of the [Ahmedabad R User Group (ARUG).](https://www.meetup.com/ahmedabad-r-users-group/) With over 14 years of experience in statistical programming and data sciences in the clinical research industry, Sanket spearheaded the formation of ARUG to create a dedicated community focused on applying R in clinical research and pharmaceutical industries. 

Since its official setup in 2023, ARUG has rapidly grown into a vibrant group with over 100 active members. The community fosters collaboration, knowledge-sharing, and mentorship, contributing significantly to the broader R ecosystem. Sanket’s dedication to data science and community building is evident in his efforts to organize impactful events, mentor new members, and drive the group’s growth.

**Please share about your background and involvement with the RUGS group.**

I’ve been working in statistical programming and data sciences in the clinical research industry for more than 14 years, which naturally led me to explore tools that enhance data analysis and visualization. My journey with the Ahmedabad R Users Group (ARUG) began when I recognized the growing need for a dedicated community focused on applying R in our field. I was sitting with my industry friends [Paresh Parekh](http://linkedin.com/in/paresh-parekh-16734817), [Paresh Paghdar](http://linkedin.com/in/paresh-p-a2352825), [Parin Shah](http://linkedin.com/in/parin-shah-98886928), and [Rahul Pandya](http://linkedin.com/in/rapandya), discussing what we could do to bring the Ahmedabad R community together. After a few days, when we met again, I proposed setting up the ARUG. They welcomed and fully supported the vision. 

While the group was initially formed in 2021, its formal setup was completed in 2023 with collaboration from the R Consortium. Since then, I’ve been organizing events, facilitating discussions, and contributing to the group’s growth. My passion for data science and community building drives my commitment to ARUG. Beyond organizing, I also mentor new members, helping them navigate the complexities of R. It’s incredibly rewarding to see the community thrive and to witness the impact of our collective efforts on advancing the field. ARUG is the first city-based group in India associated with R Consortium and the only R user group focused on Clinical Research & Pharmaceutical Industries.

**Can you share what the R community is like in Ahmedabad?** 

Ahmedabad, a world heritage city known for its rich history and vibrant culture, is also known for its Pharma Industry. Ahmedabad is now emerging as a significant hub for clinical research, data sciences, and pharmaceutical innovation. The R community in Ahmedabad is vibrant and rapidly growing, especially within these sectors. With over 100 active members, our community is a diverse mix of seasoned professionals and enthusiastic newcomers. This diversity fosters a collaborative environment where knowledge-sharing and mentorship flourish. The enthusiasm and engagement at our events reflect the community’s dedication to advancing their skills and contributing to the broader R ecosystem. We’ve seen a significant increase in participation and interest, indicating the strong potential for R to drive innovation and efficiency in our industry. The city’s dynamic and innovative spirit resonates through our community, making it an exciting place for anyone passionate about data science and clinical research.

The meetup was a highly anticipated event entitled ‘R Evolution: Shaping the Future of Clinical Trials.’ We chose this topic because it aligns perfectly with the emerging demand for R in our industry and aims to make our attendees aware of the transformative potential R brings to clinical research. Here’s a quick recap:

I started the event by taking attendees through the inspiring journey of the Ahmedabad R Users Group (ARUG). I shared key updates, our association with the R Consortium, and outlined ARUG’s long-term goals. The overwhelming response, with event registration filling up within 24 hours, highlighted the high expectations and enthusiasm of our attendees!

[Sunil Gupta](http://linkedin.com/in/sassavvy), a renowned industry expert, delivered an incredible presentation on ‘R Made Easier for SAS Programmers.’ His insights, tips, and tricks on transitioning to R were invaluable, offering a comprehensive learning experience.

Following his session, we enjoyed a vibrant networking session, making new connections and reconnecting with old friends.

[Chintan Patel](http://linkedin.com/in/chintan-patel-291a3553) captivated us with a simplified demonstration of creating Kaplan Meier Plots using R. His comprehensive topic coverage inspired many to delve deeper into graphing with R.

[Mitesh Patel](http://linkedin.com/in/miteshpatel5056) then presented ‘R Shiny in Action,’ explaining the fundamentals and applications of R Shiny, complete with a live demonstration of three case studies. His session highlighted R Shiny’s potential as a game-changer in data visualization.

I then hosted a dynamic round table discussion on conferences, joined by [Parin Shah](http://linkedin.com/in/parin-shah-98886928), [Purvi Kalra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/purvi-kalra-csm%C2%AE-8b506a14/?originalSubdomain=in), and [Saumil Tripathi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saumil-tripathi-40a90b65/).

For planning and executing our events, we rely on a combination of tools such as [GitHub](https://github.com/ssinojia/ARUG/tree/main) for collaborative project management and repositories, Zoom for virtual sessions, and [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/ahmedabad-r-users-group/) and [LinkedIn ARUG](https://www.linkedin.com/company/arug/about/) pages for continuous engagement and communication. These tools not only streamline our processes but also enhance accessibility. By utilizing these technologies, we can include members who cannot attend physical events, making our group more inclusive. We share our event summaries and slides on GitHub, ensuring that valuable information is accessible to all members. Additionally, we are considering recording sessions and sharing them on platforms like YouTube to further extend the reach of our events. Using these tools also allows us to gather feedback and improve future events, ensuring we meet the evolving needs of our community. This approach helps us maintain a vibrant and connected community, regardless of geographical limitations.

**We would like to get to know you more personally. Can you please tell me about yourself? For example, hobbies/interests or anything you want to share about yourself.**

Outside of my professional life, I have several passions that I pursue with great enthusiasm. I enjoy blogging and sharing my thoughts on data science, industry trends, and personal reflections. The mountains always call me, and I find peace and inspiration in hiking and exploring nature. Additionally, I write poetry in my local language, allowing me to express my creativity and connect with my cultural roots. These hobbies provide a balanced and enriching life, complementing my professional endeavors.

Apart from ARUG, I volunteer with organizations like [CDISC](https://www.cdisc.org/), [PHUSE](https://phuse.global/), [Pharmaverse](https://pharmaverse.org/), and [RinPharma](https://rinpharma.com/), contributing to various projects such as [SDTM IG v3.4 development](https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/sdtmig/sdtmig-v3-4), [CDISC Primer development](https://www.cdisc.org/primer), and [Shiny for Submission](https://learn.rinpharma.com/shiny4submissions.html). These experiences offer me a unique perspective and a sense of tranquility that I bring into my work, enhancing my creativity and problem-solving abilities. Engaging in these activities helps me maintain a holistic approach to my professional and personal life.

I cherish spending time with my family, especially with my adorable daughter Saanvi. My better half, Niza, always supports and encourages me in all aspects of life. She is dedicated to taking care of our family and provides unwavering support that allows me to pursue my passions and professional goals.
